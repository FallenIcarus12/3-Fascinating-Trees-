<div  style= " text-align: center; width: 50%;  margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> 
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.4em;"> This tree is named that because of its dark red sap, which in ancient times was used by many as a medicine and dye. Nowadays it is mostly used as a varnish. 
This tree is a native to the Socotra archipelago which is a part of Yemen, located in the Arabian sea. It is the national tree of Yemen and is classified as an evergreen species. 
The tree’s unique shape is something it evolved to keep water in the intense desert heat. When there is rain or most likely mist, the tree needs to have some of it stick to its leaves so that it doesn't land on the ground and evaporate. As the water runs down the tree it is able to absorb it so that it doesn’t die.
The average tree “measures up to 9 m (30 ft) in height and 12 m (39 ft) across the crown, and the trunk reaches up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in)” (Wikipedia). The tree has small berries that turn orange when they ripe, which is when birds eat them and spread the seeds. It normally blooms around March and the flowers grow on the end of the branches. They tend to be white or green. 
Dragon Blood trees are extremely rare and only live in one place. They are amazing and we should do everything in our power to keep them alive. </p>

<div style= " text-align: center; width: 50%;  margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;     font-size: 1.4em;"> The baobab trees are a rare type of tree that are originally native to Africa, Australia, and Madagascar. They can grow to be really huge, from 20 to 100 feet tall and a 7 to 10 feet diameter trunk. The trees are able to live for thousands of years, some estimated to live up to 3,000. Their flowers are really large and are reproductive for up to 15 hours. They are large, white, and bloom only at night. They wilt by the next day. It’s fruit is large and oval-like. Humans can eat it, the pulp is normally eaten raw though it can be dried and made into a powder that can go into many things. The seeds are also edible and can be roasted. Baobabs can store a lot of water in their trucks, up to 120,000 litres or 32,000 US gallons.</p>
